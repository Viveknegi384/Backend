ðŸ”· Top Part: Dynamic Website (Server-Side Rendered)
This section shows how traditional dynamic websites work.

Flow:

Database â†’ fetch data.
Use a template to generate HTML.
Website is built on the server.
Browser receives fully built HTML+CSS+JS.
This process is called Server-Side Rendering.

Example: Websites made using PHP, Django, or EJS with Node.js.

ðŸ’¡ The part circled in red shows: "This course focuses on this" â€” probably teaching how to build such websites.


ðŸ”· Bottom Part: API-Powered Website (Client-Side Rendered)
This shows a modern approach where the backend and frontend are separated.

Backend:

Database fetches data â†’ sends as JSON via API.
Frontend (Browser):
React, Angular, etc. (shown in icons) fetch that JSON.
Then build the website in the browser using templates.
So the rendering happens on the client-side (browser).

This is called Client-Side Rendering (CSR).


ðŸ’¡ Note:
The bottom is best for Single Page Applications (SPAs).
The top is good for SEO-friendly pages like blogs or marketing sites.
